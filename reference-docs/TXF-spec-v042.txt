                            and medicine"
                       368 changed "Sales of livestock raised" to
                            "Sales livestock/crops raised"
                       379 changed "Principal Business/Prof" to
                            "Principal Product"
                       445, 475, 476, 477, 478  changed 'FRM'
                            from a '3' to a '1'
                       all Form 2119 tokens changed to multiple copy
                       all Form 3903 tokens changed to multiple copy
                       all Form 4684 tokens changed to multiple copy
            NOTE: The TXF file generated by future versions of Quicken (Dos 8,
                  Mac 5,Win 4)will follow the spec for the location of 'sales net'
                  "cost basis" in Record Format 4 for capital gains.  However,
                  previous version did have the locations of these fields reversed
                  and must be taken into consideration when imported by tax
                  preparation software.

            NOTE: Intuit's Quicken products will continue to reverse the
            Record Format 4 for capital gains this year - the 'sales net'
            precedes the 'cost basis'.  All other users of the TXF have
            indicated theywill follow the Format 4 that is included in this
            spec (the 'cost basis' precedes the 'sales net').

*** 6/3/93   019 Wendell Smith
            Reviewed and integrated new tokens entered by Georgia Taft.
            New tokens are #482 - #513 and mostly are for new fields.
            THE MAJOR EXCEPTION is new fields for W2-Spouse!!! see
            a note below the revision history as to how these must be
            used.

            THIS SET OF TOKENS IS TO BE VIEWED AS THE 1993 SET

            The expectation is that we will NOT make major changes as of
            this version.

*** 6/2/93   018 Georgia Taft
            Updated ChipSoft contact people.
            Modified spec to add 32 new tokens.
            Removed #354 Breeding Fees, no longer a separate line on Sch F
            (now included in Veterinary and medicine, line 33).

            - Clarified various areas of the spec. (no changes to spec)
            - Removed W2-P categories.  This form was not used in 1991.
            For future reference categories removed will be moved to
            a section at the end of the document.
            - Modified spec for Sched D items (format 4) the spec was in
            error, the first amount should be the cost and the second the
            sale price.
            - Removed EFN column in the table.  If we need this later we
            can add it in, currently it was not filled in and was unused.
            - The line number references in the table must be updated to
            1991.

____________________________________________________________
** III.  W2-SPOUSE tokens 6/3/93

A set of tokens for W2-Spouse have been added to support Quicken products.
The tokens were added to avoid the need to use the "spouse"
token for W2's.  It is critical that the copy numbers be managed
correctly with these new tokens as the copy number passed with
the refnum will NOT be the copy number of the W-2 in the tax program.
The copy number with the W2-Spouse tokens must be kept separate
from the copy numbers for the W2-Self tokens.

SO if there were 3 w2-spouse copies and 2 w2-self copies
the resulting tax return will have 5 copies but the copy numbers
may be mixed so the matchup might look like:

Finance Program       Tax Program
  w2-spouse (1)   ->  w2 (1)
  w2-self (1)     ->  w2 (2)
  w2-spouse (2)   ->  w2 (3)
  w2-spouse (3)   ->  w2 (4)
  w2-self (2)     ->  w2 (5)

____________________________________________________________
** IV.   CHANGES
*** 11/30/2011 - added seven new taxrefs to supplement existing taxrefs (321,323,673 and 682) used for reporting sales of securities.
  Sales get reported on Copy A, B or C of the new Form 8949, and then flow to the Sch D.
  These new taxrefs will allow you to indicate which copy of Form 8949 a sale belongs on:
  Form 8949 Copy A : (you repored cost basis for this sale to the IRS using Form 1099B Box 3)
      321 (Short term holding period); 323 (long term holding period); 673 (you don't know the holding period); 682 (wash);

  Form 8949 Copy B : (you provide cost basis to customer, but you do NOT report it to the IRS using Form 1099B Box 3)
      711 (short term, Copy B); 713 (long term, Copy B); 715 (unknown holding period, Copy B); 718 (wash, Copy B)

  Form 8949 Copy C : (no 1099B issued customer or IRS)
      712 (short term, Copy C); 714 (long term, Copy C); 716 (unknown holding period, Copy C)

*** 08/25/2011 - expanded the use for Record Format 5 to support new
   Cost Basis requirements. Record Format 5 will now allow sending Disallowed Cost Basis amount for
   tax refs 321,323, 673,682.

*** 10/04/2002 - added a taxref for the reporting of wash sales (taxref 682)
   682 will use record format 4 - the same as short term gain/loss (321) and
   long term gain/loss (323).

*** 10/02/2001 - Clarification:  the "Line" indicator in the layout of the
  table is used for the IRS line location. This may cause confusion when
  looking for taxrefs in the Spec. Example: a new taxref (677) was
  added to version 038 for 'Qualified 5-year gain' - this amount may get reported
  on a 1099-Div, but ends up on the Schedule D when filing the return. So,
  677 is located in the SchD section of the Spec. Historically, the Spec has
  always put the taxref in the section of the form/schedule where the
  data will actually get reported. Another example would be the
  taxref's for Interest. Interest may get reported on a 1099-Int, but it
  ends up getting reported on the Sch B, so those taxrefs are in the Schedule B
  section of the Spec.

*** 11/11/1999 - Added a new token (673) to SchD for Short/Long term gain
          or loss. This token can be used when you cannot accurately
          determine whether the gain/loss from a sale is short or long term.

          Note: As is the case with any token in this TXF spec, you may
                want to verify that the software you are creating the
                TXF file for supports this token.

*** 6/26/1999 - Changed all date formats to mm/dd/yyyy

*** 9/10/96 - 'X' detail line proposal: Some financial programs export detail
information in the 'X' line of a detail (TD) record format.  To facilitate
parsing this information, for those tax programs who wish to import all
or some of the string, it is recommended that a standard columnar separation
be followed:

      X identifier        1 char        Position 0:0
      Date                8 chars       Position 1:8
      Account            30 chars       Position 10:39
      Check Number        6 chars       Position 41:46
      Payee              40 chars       Position 48:87
      Memo               40 chars       Position 89:128
      Category           15 chars       Position 130:144

The upcoming versions of Quicken Win 6.0 and Quicken Mac 7.0 will follow these
guidelines to test the feasibility of this columnar separation.  Please contact
Georgia Taft @ Intuit with your suggestions, comments, and/or objections
to this proposed standard.

*** 8/13/96 - Since we have implemented a separate set of W-2 tokens strictly for
the spouse, token #459 will be removed in the next version of the spec (summer
*** 1997).  Please contact Georgia Taft @ Intuit if you are using the spouse
token #459.

*** 2/1/93 - Perhaps we should modify the spec to indicate that the purchase
amount for cap gains should be reported as positive (This is how quicken and
MYM are currently set up.)  7/26/95(GT) - spec was never updated with this
information, but appears industry has followed.

Should we revise the spec to have purchase amount after selling amount?
this is how quicken is currently setup. (MYM9 has reversed this)
7/26/95(GT) - In 1994, Quicken reversed output to follow the spec.
____________________________________________________________
** V.    NEW TOKENS

11/07/92 - tokens for Keogh Self/Spouse (replace single keogh token)
7/26/95 - these tokens added to version 024

____________________________________________________________
** VI.   QUESTIONS

What should the "sort" category for the Schedule D items be?  The Tax forms
require each transaction (sale) to be reported as a separate item.  This is
also true for form 4797. 7/26/95(GT) - this question must have been posed
when the spec was being written.  There is no special sorting for
Schedule D.

Should the "type" for items such as SchedE "Other expenses" be "2"?
7/26/95(GT) - Other expenses are usually record format 3; the type is either
S or D for Type Detail or Type Summary.

7/26/95
We originally set aside token numbers 1000 and above
for International use. There is some concern that we could run out of
available numbers for U.S. programs.  Has anyone begun using the 1000
and above refnums for International?  Does anyone have a problem with
increasing these to 2000 and above?

____________________________________________________________
** VII.  TAX LINE ITEM MAINTENANCE FILE DESCRIPTION.
*** A. Description

This file is used for maintenance of the tax items available to accounting
software for export to tax preparation software.  Intuit will maintain
this file and make it available to all interested parties (accounting and
tax software providers), but the tax software companies are to provide
updates to the information as it becomes available to them.

The file will be maintained as an ascii file with no tabs.

The "Tax Export Format" specifies the format of a file containing records
of tax data where each record defines the critical information required by
the tax products to process the record.  The record format is defined as
an ascii file where each record is separated by a marker line which has one
character "^".  Each field in the exchange record is a separate line with
a single character at start of the line defining the field in the record
the line is referring to.

For each type of record there are two flavors.  The first and most
important is the summary record.  Each tax item should have one summary
record for each line on the tax form.  Preceding a summary record, there
may be one or many detail records that provide supporting detail for the
summary record.  In all cases these detail record may be safely ignored by
the tax software.  However, they may be useful as supporting information.

There will be a header at the top of the file with several items to help
synchronize this file with tax programs.

All Tax Exchange Files should have a header which defines what version
of this spec was used as well as what program was used to create
the import file.

The fields for the Header of the file are:

  V version
  A accounting program name/version
  D export date

For each exchange record there are a set of common fields. This is the
recommended order:

  T type
  N refnum
  C copy
  L line
  X detail

There are 7 record formats, labeled 0 through 6 with various
additional fields.

The fields for these record formats are:

Record Format 0


  Note: used for boolean records such as "spouse" indicator

Record Format 1 (placed before the 'X' detail line in the record)
  $ amount

Record Format 2
  P Text value

  Note: String value used for "description" fields such as Sched C Line A

Record Format 3
  $ amount
  P description

  Note: used for fields such as interest where bank name/account#
        and $ amount required.

Record Format 4
  P security
  D date acquired
  D date sold
  $ cost basis
  $ sales net (net of commission)

Record Format 5
  P security
  D date acquired
  D date sold
  $ cost basis
  $ sales net
  $ Depreciation Allowed OR Disallowed wash sale amount (added for TY11)

  Note: expanded Format 5 to use for new TY11 cost basis reporting rules. Format 5 will
   be used with Taxrefs 321,323,673,682,711,712,713,714,715,716 when reporting a disallowed wash sale amount.

Record Format 6
  D date paid
  $ amount paid
  P state initials

  Note: used for quarterly federal and state estimated tax payments; state
        initials ignored for federal estimates.

*** B. Codes and Definition of Fields

"V" Version
  Indicates which version of the tax line item maintenance file was used to
  export this file. The current number can be found at the top of this file.

"A" Accounting Program Name/Version
  Indicates which program (including version) exported this file.

"D" Export Date
  Date on which this file was exported.

"T" Type
  Either S for summary or D for detail.  Default value is S.

"N" Refnum
  The tax category refnum for this item.  There is not default value (it
  must be supplied).  This refnum should come from the tax line item
  maintenance file.

"C" Copy
  Integer between 1 and 255.  Default value is 1.  This is the copy number
  for multi-copy forms (such as Schedule C.)  If there is only one copy, the
  value should be 1.

"L" Line
  A positive integer.  The default value is 1.  This is the line number for
  multi-line items, such as interest income on Schedule B.  If there is only
  one line item, this number should be 1.

"X" Detail
  Extra text that can be used by the tax software, if desired.  The initial
  intent of this field is for use in a supporting statement.

"$" Amount
  This is the dollar amount for the item.  Income, gains, and money received
  are positive numbers.  Expenses, losses, and money spent (including tax
  payments) are negative numbers.

"P" Description
  A string describing this particular line.  This is the value that is
  different and describes the line and therefore should appear on the line
  on the tax form.

"P" Security
  Name of security for schedule D.

"D" Date Acquired
  Acquisition date.  It should be in the form MM/DD/YYYY.

"D" Date Sold
  Sale date.  It should be in the form MM/DD/YYYY.

"D" Date Paid
  Payment date.  It should be in the form MM/DD/YYYY.


Default means that a line does not need to be supplied not that if the
field is supplied with no value the "default" will be used.  So if
NO "C" field is supplied then the default of Copy 1 is to be used.

____________________________________________________________

** VIII. EXAMPLE FILES
*** EXAMPLE 1:
  1.  The user has a Quicken category called donations.  They set the tax
      item for this category to "Schedule A:Cash Charity Contributions".

  2.  They apply "Schedule B:Interest income" to their category
      called Interest Earned.

  3.  They have expense categories called Ads:Magazine and Ads:TV.  They
      apply the tax item "Schedule C:Advertising" to both of these
      categories.

For example given the following entries a sample export file is included.

  Schedule A; Charitable Contributions          $625.00
  Schedule B; Interest Income     Checking      $120.00
                                  Savings       $220.00
  Schedule C; Advertising         Ads:Magazine  $568.00
                                  Ads:TV        $100.00

*** EXAMPLE 2: SCHEDULE D, CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES - Taxrefs 321,323,673,682,711,712,713,714,715,716,718:

 ** New rules for reporting cost basis are in effect starting 2011.
    One of the new requirements is to report disallowed wash sale amount. The easiest way
    for us to implement was to use an existing TXF record format. Record Format 5 was
    chosen. If you are reporting a sale that has a disallowed wash amount, use Record Format 5.

 * You must use record format 4 or 5 for Schedule D transactions.
   It is imperative that you follow the format exactly so that
   the data gets mapped correctly. If you do not have the Date Acquired
   and/or the Cost Basis for the transaction, you still need to follow
   the record format 4 or 5. If you cannot correctly determine whether the
   gain/loss is short term  or long term, then use token 673. See Example 2B below.

 * NOTE: you could use format 5 for all sales (321,323,673,682,711,712,713,714,715,716,718). When there is no disallowed loss amount to report,
   simply leave the last line in the record empty:

Ex: Short term sale, no disallowed wash to report: Record format 5. Will go to Copy A of 8949

** IX.   TABLE FORMAT

To mark the start/end of the table the strings "^ START OF TABLE" and
"^ END OF TABLE" are used.  This is to permit developers to use this
file to define the current set of categories.

To permit both accounting packages and tax packages to recognize as needed
categories which are no longer supported after the end of the current
category table there is a section marked with "^ START OLD CATEGORY" and
"^ END OLD CATEGORY"

If the layout of the table needs to change then any changes MUST be noted
so that programs using this file as input can be modified.

The current data columns and lengths are as follows:
Note that the start count is 1 based.

  Id       Start Width Description
--------------------------------
  L        1     1     Layer
  RNum     3     4     RefNum
  Name     8     30    Name of category (really only 28 chars + two " marks)
  Cpy      39    1     Copy number
  Srt      47    1     Sort type
  Sgn      xx    x     Sign of expected value
  Frm      51    1     Format type
  Line     64    15    Year:Form:Line

The "RNum" 00 is used to break between forms, and make this table
more readable.

When a field has not been set then the character "-" is used to fill the
place.


______________________________________________________________________
A.  Table Column Header Descriptions:

"L" - Level Of Indent.
  Valid values are 0-2.  0 represents a form or schedule
  name.  1 represents a section on a form, and 2 is an actual line that can
  be filled in.  Only refnums for level 2 items should be exported to tax
  software in the export file.

"RNum" - Refnum
  Unique identifier for this tax line.  Valid values are 1-999.  This value
  may not be reused in other years to mean different items.

"Name" - Name of category
  The name the user will see when referring to this tax line item.  This
  field must be 30 characters or less in length, and must be enclosed in
  quotes.  The name of the form and section should not be included in this
  name as it is implied by the items with a lower indention level above.

"Cpy" - Copy
  Valid values are Y and N.  If Y, multiple copies of this tax item are
  allowed.  This is useful for schedules which may be submitted with many
  copies (like Schedule C).

"Srt" - Sort
  Valid values are N, A, C and P.  N indicates no sorting or subtotaling
  within the tax line is necessary.  A indicates that the items within the
  tax line should be sorted and subtotaled by the asset or liability
  associated with the transaction (the Quicken account).  C indicates a
  sorting and subtotaling by the income or expense associated with the
  transaction (the Quicken category).  P indicates sorting and subtotaling
  by the name associated with the transaction (the Quicken payee).

"Sgn" - Sign
  Valid values are I, E, B and S.  I indicates this is an income line and
  that the normal sign for an exported value for this tax line item is '+'.
  E indicates this is an expense line and the normal sign is '-'.
  B indicates either + or - is expected, and 'S' indicates a string value.

"Frm" - Record Format
  Valid values are 0-6. See format descriptions in Section VII for more info.

"Line" - IRS line location
  The line indicates which year, schedule and line number on the schedule
  this tax item represents.  It is provided to uniquely describe the line
  number for the tax software companies and to indicate the last year this
  item was used or updated.

  More than one category can go to the same line on the tax form.  In many
  cases a tax program may present a worksheet with each item listed or
  the items can be just totaled into the line specified.


____________________________________________________________
** X.    CATEGORIES

LAST REFNUM = 717

When adding new categories you must update the Last Refnum so we can
always use a new number for new categories.

The lines of numbers below specify the layout of the table.  The first two
lines are used to locate the start locations of a field and the third to see
the length of each field.
