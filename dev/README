Notes:

In a grammar, to get the line number of a token (thanks to @moritz on IRC 2020-11-07):


say “ab\ncd\n\ef” ~~ /cd/;
say 1 + $/.prematch.trim-trailing.lines.elems

# Note the line numbers are indexed from zero but conventionally we
# talk about line numbers from one so we simply add the 1 to the
# result.

my $linenumber = $/.prematch.trim-trailing.lines.elems + 1;
